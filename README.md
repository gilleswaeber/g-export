g-export
========
Export a game list from GOG Galaxy as an HTML page.
The HTML page is located in the dist folder as well as all resources (e.g. game covers).

Requirements: Python 3.7+, Python packages: pandas requests steam tqdm:
```sh
python -m pip install pandas requests steam[client] tqdm
```

Example usage:
```sh
python ./export.py  # when GOG is installed, no friend games
python ./export.py --steam-id name --steam-api-key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --all-friends
```

Usage: `python export.py [-h] [--steam-id STEAM_ID] [--steam-api-key STEAM_API_KEY] [--all-friends] [--friends FRIENDS]
[--gog-db GOG_DB]`

Optional arguments:
```
